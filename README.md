# hello-word
This is my first time to learn to use Githubï¼Œtake care of me please.
Now, I'm a graduate student.I don't have much interest in programming before, however, I have to solve model emerging in my paper with program.Withour computer, I can't solve the problem which I've been studying in my paper.It can be say, I was pushed to learn python.
But after a period of study, I become incressing interest in programming.I find the use of program is not only to help me to solve my model, but also has many other interesting things such as making pictures, making things easy and funny in learning and working,and so on.
Python is not only an interest, it shows me a new world!!!
